# C'est la V

C'est la V is a website where vegan food lovers can share their favourite recipes and browse existing ones from the database.

Visitors have access to all the recipes stored on the website, can search the database for keywords and can also send a message using the contact form. To be able to add a new recipe, visitors must register as new users. Once registered and signed in, users can add, edit and delete their own recipes.

C'est la V was built using the Django Framework in Python, HTML and CSS. It provides user authentication and full CRUD functionality.
